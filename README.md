	# Internship Project: Real-Time Linux Kernel Development

## Overview

This repository documents the work completed during my internship at HCL Technologies, where I focused on transforming a standard Linux kernel into a real-time (RT) kernel. The project involved applying patches, optimizing memory allocation, and enhancing overall system performance. This README outlines the methodologies used and the results obtained during the internship.

## Internship Duration

- **Start Date:** May 31, 2024  
- **End Date:** August 8, 2024  

## Project Goals

- Transform a standard Linux kernel into a real-time (RT) kernel.
- Improve kernel stability and performance.
- Validate modifications using the Linux Testing Project (LTP).

## Key Tasks

- **C Programming:** Gained proficiency in C programming, focusing on syntax, control structures, and standard libraries.
- **GitHub Repository Creation:** Set up a GitHub repository to track project progress and manage code.
- **Linux Installation:** Installed and configured Arch Linux for kernel development, ensuring compatibility with the system hardware.
- **Kernel Update:** Updated the kernel to the latest stable version and compiled it from source.
- **PREEMPT_RT Patch Application:** Applied the PREEMPT_RT patch to enable real-time capabilities and verified performance.
- **Filesystem Optimization:** Explored and implemented filesystem journaling, write-back, and write-through techniques to enhance performance.
- **Kernel Debugging:** Utilized debugging tools to address kernel crashes and performance bottlenecks.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Implemented and tested various memory allocation strategies to optimize kernel performance.
- **Testing and Validation:** Conducted extensive testing using the Linux Testing Project (LTP) to ensure kernel stability and performance after each modification.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Operating System:** Arch Linux
- **Kernel Development Tools:** Make, GCC, Git
- **Testing Framework:** Linux Testing Project (LTP)

## Results

The internship successfully enhanced the kernel's performance and stability through rigorous testing and optimization techniques. All modifications were validated using LTP, ensuring that the kernel met the necessary requirements for real-time applications.

## Conclusion

This internship provided valuable experience in kernel development, real-time systems, and performance optimization. The skills acquired during this project will significantly contribute to future endeavors in embedded systems and operating system development.
